# PSX-Eboot-Renamer

Simple script to rename PSX eboots.

The purpose of this script is to automate the process of renaming large amounts of eboots.

In my tests I did not notice any problems, if you notice, let me know, or correct yourself.

./ebootrename /folder/with/eboots
OR
~/folder_with_eboots$ /path/to/script/ebootrename.sh .
